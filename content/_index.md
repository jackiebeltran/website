       <div style="text-align: center;">
        Iâ€™m a first-generation scholar from San Diego, CA inspired by a diverse immigrant community that shaped my path into science. After earning my B.S. in Biopsychology at UC Santa Barbara, I gained clinical experience as a medical assistant before moving to New York City to pursue my PhD in Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (expected 2026).

       <br><br>

        My research integrates neuroimaging, computational modeling, and digital phenotyping to better understand mood and anxiety disorders. Alongside my research, Iâ€™ve built expertise in communicating science across audiences and am passionate about leveraging technology to expand access and equity in research. Outside the lab, I love social dancing, hiking, traveling, and trying new recipes.

      <br><br>
      Iâ€™m excited to bring my analytical and translational skills to industry roles in clinical research, digital health, or medical communications.
