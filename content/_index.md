      text: |-
        A San Diego Native currently based in New York City. My research focuses on investigating the role of the ventral tegmental area utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, computational modeling techniques and digital phenotyping. 
        
        When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy going social dancing, exploring the outdoors, and trying new vegan recipes.
